## Local vs remote exercise:

1. Become familiar with the different appearance of the local shell
2. Create local folder `~/workshop_rsd` for results
3. Log in to the aws instance with `ssh <username>@50.17.210.255`
5. Become familiar with appearance of the remote shell

## Orientation exercise

Note: We will provide additional time during this exercise to ensure that everyone is prepared to move forward.

Orientation exercise:

1. Log in (or confirm logged in) to aws instance
2. Ensure in home directory with `cd`
3. Use `cp` to copy the data from `/rsd/data/` to your home directory
4. Use `ls` to view references
5. Use `ls` to view input fastq files
6. Use `mkdir` to create a folder for our analysis

1. Ensure we're logged in to remote

        ssh <username>@50.17.210.255

2. Ensure we are in home directory

        cd

3. Copy data to our home directory

        cp -r /rsd/data/ ~/

4. View our references

        ls ~/data/refs

5. View our input fastq files

        ls ~/data/reads

6. Create a folder for our analysis

        mkdir ~/analysis

## Bonus exercise:

1. Ensure we're on remote aws instance
2. run the command `fortune | cowsay | lolcat`

Optional and only for fun!

These programs are installed 'games' for entertainment purposes.

<summary>Details about `fortune | cowsay | lolcat`</summary>

`fortune` prints a random fortune

`cowsay` is a talking cow

`lolcat` is like `cat` but with a fun twist
