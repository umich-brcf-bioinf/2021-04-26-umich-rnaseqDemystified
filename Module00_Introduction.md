# Welcome to RNA-Seq Demystified

## About this workshop

- By the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to
  - Transform raw sequencing data into annotated differential expression values using a suite of
    open-source tools.
  - Identify common data quality problems and understand their impact and possible mitigations
  - Visualize differential expression data in RStudio plots.

- This workshop is targeted toward researchers who would like to be able to run RNA-Seq analysis on their
  own. It assumes a very basic familiarity with genetics, the command line, and R or R-Studio.

- Our purpose is not to be exhaustive, and we don't expect anyone to be an expert at the end of
  the workshop. But we hope you will have a familiarity with key concepts, data types,
  tools, and how they all connect to one another in the service of a biological question.
- The first day will be a mix of hands-on content and lecture-style components, while the second
  day will primarily be a hands-on experience.

- Please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve the workshop experience.

  Biomedical Research Core Facilities (BRCF) helps researchers economically take advantage of
  the latest technology and collaborate with top experts in the field. Established in 1986, the
  BRCF was formed to offer centralized access to research services and equipment.

- [University of Michigan Library](https://www.lib.umich.edu/)

  Our mission is to support, enhance, and collaborate in the instructional, research, and
  service activities of faculty, students, and staff, and contribute to the common good by
  collecting, organizing, preserving, communicating, sharing, and creating the record of human
  knowledge.

  To strengthen University of Michigan’s preeminence in Data Science and to catalyze the
  transformative use of Data Science in a wide range of disciplines to achieve lasting societal
  impact.

## What is the Bioinformatics Core?

- The UM Bioinformatics Core is a team seven analysts; we help researchers **design, analyze,
  and interpret** high-throughput genomics experiments.
- Last year we helped about 60 researchers design and execute about 100 projects across:
    - gene expression
    - variant calling, copy-number analysis
    - chromatin accessibility and binding
    - DNA methylation
    - single-cell experiments
    - custom bioinformatic analyses
- We provide letters of support for grant proposals.
- We are also creating a series of bioinformatics-focused workshops

## Code of Conduct (CoC)

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that
  harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the workshop.

- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many
  different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

- The Bioinformatics Core is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
  regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any
  form.

- Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

- If you have questions about the CoC please reach out to the hosts during the workshop, or
  email us at bioinformatics-workshops@umich.edu.

- To report a CoC incident/concern, please email Chris Gates (Bioinformatics Core, Managing
  Director) at cgates@umich.edu or contact the University of Michigan Office of Institutional
  Equity at institutional.equity@umich.edu.


## Workshop patterns and Zoom controls

- We will be recording this session. Recordings will be available to participants following
  the workshop.

- Zoom controls are at the bottom of the Zoom window:
![Zoom controls](images/Module00_zoom_controls.png)

- To minimize distractions, we encourage participants to keep their audio muted (1) (unless
  actively asking a question).
- To maximize engagement, we encourage participants to keep their video on.
- **Chat** can be used to communicate to the group or to individuals.
- Zoom's "non-verbal controls" are a useful way to interact
  - Depending on your version of Zoom you can access these either
    - in the **Reactions** button on you main Zoom window
    - at the bottom of the **Participant** pane

![Zoom non verbals](images/Module00_zoom_nonverbals.png)

  - **Raise Hand** to request clarification or ask a question. (Same an in-person workshop.)
  - **Yes** when you complete an assigned task or other instructor feedback
  - **No** to request assistance from helper
    - Hosts will connect you with a helper in a breakout room.


### Schedule

TBD

### Any questions?
 -
 -

### Breakout Rooms

 - We're all going to be transported into randomized breakout rooms to see what that's like.
 - Introduce yourself and share a reason you signed up for this workshop.
 - When you have completed introductions, you can leave the breakout room to rejoin the main room.
